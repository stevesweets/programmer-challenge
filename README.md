# programmer-challenge

Two challenges are laid ahead;

Feel free to fork the repository as a private one somewhere and send that private link back to us. Please make regular commits so we can see your thought process.

First;
There is a straight php challenge in php-test, designed to test your understanding of OOP.

Second;
The laravel test has a few challenges in it.

- Get a database set up.
- Get the migrations run.
- Fix the errors you find when you open it in a browser.
- You will see an xlsx file in storage/app/public, import it into the posts table created by the migration. I suggest using a composer package for this.
